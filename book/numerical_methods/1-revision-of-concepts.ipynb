    "Equations can be solved in two ways: analytically and numerically. The analytical solution is **exact** while a numerical solution requires computational methods to **approximate** the solution. So why would we use anything other than analytical solutions? Well, analytical solutions are difficult/impossible to find for complex equations, specially when the problem involves a complex geometry. This complexity will be treated later in the book. For now, let's illustrate analytical and numerical solutions considering a simple problem.\n",
