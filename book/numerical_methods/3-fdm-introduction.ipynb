    "# Finite Difference Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is an indispensable numerical approach, which plays a fundamental role in solving differential equations that govern physical phenomena. In this method, the derivatives in the differential equation are approximated using numerical differences, just like the forward, backward and central differences treated in the previous chapters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following equation that describes ice growth of an ice layer assuming that the air and water temperatures are constant: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_{ice}\\frac{dh_{ice}}{dt}=-k_{ice}\\frac{T_{water}-T_{air}}{h_{ice}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h_{ice}$ is the ice thickness, $\\rho_{ice}$ ice density and $k_{ice}$ refers to the heat transfer capabilities of the ice. \n",
    "\n",
    "The growth rate (derivative) if the ice thickness can be approximated with one of the numerical derivatives and the resulting equation can be solved for the ice thickness in the next time step. In essence, the finite difference method transforms a differential equation into an algebraic form (discretization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Still a definition of the solution domain is needed. For this example, an inital and an end time $[a,b]$, where $a$ and $b$ are called **end points**. The domain is represented as **grid points** and therefore in a number of subintervals $N$. The length of the subinterval is $h=(b-a)/N$.\n",
