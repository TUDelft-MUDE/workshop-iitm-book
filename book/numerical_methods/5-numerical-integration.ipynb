    "## Motivation\n",
    "Numerical integration is used often in diverse fields of engineering. For example to develop advanced numerical model techniques or to analyze field or laboratory data where a desired physical quantity is an integral of other measured quantitites. So, the analytic integral is not always known and has to be computed (approximated) numerically. For example, the variance density spectrum (in ocean waves) is a discrete signal obtained from the water level variations and its **integral** is a quantity that characterizes the wave field. \n"
