# Software Installation

The software installation pages guide you through the process for installing several tools that we will use on a daily basis in MUDE. A brief overview is provided here:
- Miniconda: a software distribution that includes:
  - the Python programming language (we will use version 3.12)
  - Conda (or `conda`): an environment manager
  - a few other tools to make things go smoothly, for example the Python package manager `pip`
- Visual Studio Code (abbreviated VS Code or VSC):
  - this is our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice becuase of its ease-of-use, flexibility and collaboration features
  - note that VSC is an alternative to Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab IDE's, which you may have used in the past
- Jupyter: a Python-based software
  - Note that Jupyter Notebooks are a file format (extension `*.ipynb`), and Jupyter Notebook is also an IDE
  - We will install Jupyter in our computing environment using `conda` and interact with the Jupyter Notebook `*.ipynb` files using VSC as our IDE

```{note}
If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks you should spend some time getting comfortable; hopefully you have a patient group member that is willing to show you a few tricks. Even for those who have used them before, if you are unfamiliar with VS Code you will need a few minutes to get used to the slightly different interface.
