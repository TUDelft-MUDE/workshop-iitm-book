# Programming, Week 1.1: Getting Started!

The purpose of this week is to get software installed and be prepared to work with Python code and Jupyter Notebooks. This includes some programming "theory" to help you understand what you are doing with the MUDE software stack, and why we use particular tools. A brief introduction to [Computers and Computing Environments](week_1_1/environments.md) is provided before the [software installation instructions](week_1_1/install.md). Once the software is ready, you are able to read and implement the information in: the [File System](week_1_1/files.md) and [Python Warmup](week_1_1/warmup.ipynb) sections:

% This chapter relies heavily on material proved in the [Learn programming book](https://teachbooks.github.io/learn-programming)
