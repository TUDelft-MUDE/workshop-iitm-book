# Probability axioms

The discussion about what probability is, as well as the interpretation of what it means, has been going on for centuries, and we wonâ€™t cover it here. Lukcily, most modern perspectives on probability are compatible and can be traced back to a few key fundamental concepts, known as the axioms of probability. These three axioms are summarized here:
1. The probability of any event is $[0,1]$.
2. The set of all possible outomes has probability 1.0.
3. If two events are mutually exclusive, the probability of both events (the union) is the sum of their probabilities: $P[A \cup B]=P(A)+P(B)$

While they may seem simple, these axioms are actually precise mathematical statements that provide the basis for a number of theorems and proofs which allow us to apply probability theory to a wide range of applications.
